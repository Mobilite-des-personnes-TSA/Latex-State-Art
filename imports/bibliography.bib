  abstract = {Background Public transport is low cost, allows for independence, and facilitates engagement and participation for non-drivers. However, the viewpoints of individuals with cognitive disabilities are rarely considered. In Australia, the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is approximately 1\% and increasing. Many individuals with ASD do not possess a driver's licence, indicating that access to public transport is crucial for their independence. However, at present, there is no research on the opinions of adults with ASD on public transport. Aim To identify the viewpoints of adults with ASD regarding the barriers and facilitators of public transport usage and their transportation preferences, and to contrast these against the viewpoints of neurotypical adults. Methods Q method was used to identify the viewpoints of both participant groups on public transport. Participants consisted of 55 adults with a diagnosis of ASD and a contrast group of 57 neurotypical adults. Both groups completed a Q sort task which took place in either Perth or Melbourne, Australia. Results The most prominent viewpoint indicated that both groups preferred to use public transport over driving and believed that it supported their independence. This viewpoint also indicated that both groups preferred to use electronic ticketing when using public transport. Interestingly, the second most prominent viewpoint indicated that both groups preferred to drive themselves by private car rather than use public transport. Discussion It appears that the viewpoints of adults with and without ASD regarding public transportation were largely similar. However, questions arose about whether the preference for public transport in the ASD group may be more a result of difficulties obtaining a driving licence than a deliberate choice. The only barrier specified by adults with ASD related to crowding on public transport. Safety and convenience in relation to location and timing of services were barriers reported by neurotypical adults.},

The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a novel cyber-physical infrastructure that can effectively and efficiently transform existing transportation hubs into smart facilities capable of providing better location-aware services. We investigated the integration of a number of internet of the things (IoT) elements, including video analytics, Bluetooth beacons, mobile computing, and facility semantic models, to provide reliable indoor navigation services to people with special needs, yet requiring minimum infrastructure changes. Our pilot tests with people with special needs at a multi-floor building in New York City has demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

Specifically, this research aims to provide practical guidelines on how to design urban policies and urban design projects, such that they improve the capabilities of people with ASD to walk across the city and access relevant public urban spaces and facilities. Although this is a well-defined field of research, this paper should be seen as a contribution to the debate on the understanding of disability as a product of processes of human-environment interaction and as an attempt to address issues of mobility for people with disabilities by taking into account their personal characteristics and capabilities. Current methodological and operational efforts on the role of spatial configuration as a means for improving the autonomy of people with ASD focus almost exclusively on the design of closed, separated, private spaces, devoted only to people with ASD (mainly children). Starting from these considerations, the paper describes a research project aimed at defining an integrated set of urban mobility policies and extra-small urban design projects to provide people with ASD a real opportunity of using their city.},

Challenges with typical social engagement, common in the autism experience, can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of individuals and families living with autism. Recent advances in sensing, intelligent, and interactive technologies can enable new forms of assistive and augmentative technologies to support social interactions. However, researchers have not yet demonstrated effectiveness of these technologies in long-term real-world use. This article presents an overview of the social and sensory challenges of autism, which offer great opportunities and challenges for the design and development of assistive technologies. We review existing work on developing wearable technologies for autism particularly to assist social interactions, analyze their potential and limitations, and discuss future research directions.},

  abstract = {Emotional intelligence is not only a social skill for human beings, but also a challenging research topic in human-computer interaction related to the ability to recognize particular emotional patterns of humans by machines. Studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) can trigger stronger and more specific emotional reactivity in users than other visual/audio media. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually suffer from social impairments, such as challenges in emotion perception and emotion expression. A smart VR eHealth system that carefully triggers specific emotional reactions and detects the patterns in children with ASD can help with early screening, intervention, and emotional regulation. This paper proposes a VR gaming system that makes use of psychophysiological sensor signals, in-game performance and responses, stressor mini-games to detect different emotional reactivity patterns, and dynamically changes the game scene according to the current emotional status. This is a framework of a long-term study, where the ultimate goal is to develop a VR system with real-time feedback to assist early screening and diagnosis of ASD.},

  abstract = {The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.},

Several solutions are proposed to help citizens move around in an urban environment. Most are not yet aware of the universal and accessible aspect that these solutions must have. This paper proposes a route support system embedded in a mobile application, Viana+Acess{\'i}vel, using a multi-objective approach. The application aims to promote accessible mobility within the city, contributing to physical and psychological well-being for citizens with reduced mobility, temporary or permanently, such as people with spectrum autism disorder, the visually impaired, wheelchair users, pregnant, and the elderly. For the evaluation of the algorithms, four objective measures were considered: accessibility, slope, time, and length of the paths. The tests carried out with different routing algorithms showed that the A-Star presented the fastest results in terms of execution time compared to the Dijkstra, Floyd{\textendash}Warshall, and Bellman{\textendash}Ford. When analysing in a multi-objective approach, time, slope and accessibility were demonstrated to be conflicting objectives. Bi-objective and tri-objective were applied and Pareto front was explored.},
